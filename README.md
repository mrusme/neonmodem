[*Neon Modem Overdrive*][neonmodem] is a [BBS][wiki-bbs]-style command line client that 
supports [Discourse][discourse], [Lemmy][lemmy], [Lobsters][lobsters] and 
[Hacker News][hackernews] as backends, and seamlessly integrates all of them 
into a streamlined TUI. And yes, you heard that right, I really did call it 
*Neon Modem Overdrive*.

*Neon Modem* is built in Go, using [Charm's Bubble Tea][bubbletea] TUI 
framework, but implements an own *window manager* (or *compositor* if you want) 
that allows it to use a third dimension, on top of the two dimensional rendering 
that Bubble Tea offers today. With that it is possible to display dialogs on top 
of one another, in order to offer a smoother UI experience.

## Configuration

Before launching *Neon Modem Overdrive* it requires initial setup of the 
services (a.k.a. *systems*). Run `neonmodem connect --help` to find out more.

Connecting a service will add it to the configuration TOML. The configuration 
file location depends on the operating system. On Unix systems, it is in 
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/neonmodem.toml` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is non-empty, otherwise 
`$HOME/.config/neonmodem.toml` is used. On Darwin, the configuration is in 
`$HOME/Library/Application Support/neonmodem.toml`. On Windows, it is in 
`%AppData%\neonmodem.toml`.

## FAQ

- **Q:** The post view is really slow when using a large terminal.\
  **A:** Turning off image rendering will improve performance significantly on 
  very large terminal windows and can be done by setting `RenderImages = false` 
  in the configuration.
- **Q:** Can I haz Reddit?\
  **A:** I won't do the heavy lifting of integrating a proprietary platform with 
  a $15 billion valuation that can't even be bothered to maintain a solid set of 
  client API libraries. If you feel like, go ahead and PR!
